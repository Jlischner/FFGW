To compile on HOPPER:
----------------------
1) module unload fftw
2) module load fftw/2.1.5.4
3) make

Getting mean-field input from QUANTUM ESPRESSO:
-----------------------------------------------
1) run scf calc to get ground state density
2) run nscf calc to get empty states 
2b) for defects: need shifted q-grid calculation
3) convert ESPRESSO output to ascii:
for non-magnetic systems: run pw2ffgw1.sh in director where wave functions are stored (something like ch4.save/K00001/)
=> this creates 3 files: evc1, eigenval1 and gkvectors in that directory
for magnetic systems: run pw2ffgw2.sh
4) link input files:
- go to directory where you want to run
- link to evc1 and evc2 (for non-magnetic systems we also need evc2 = evc1)
- link to eigenval1 and eigenval2 (for non-magnetic systems eigenval2 = eigenval1)
- link to gkvectors
- link to eigenvalues G - denoted eigenval_1 and eigenval_2 (for G0W0: eigenval_1=eigenval1)
5) modify input file ffgw.inp
6) run via: ./ffgw.x > out 
7) analyse output stored in sig_out: 1st col is frq grid, 2nd col is ReSig, 3rd col is ImSig
Note: that the static remainder is always included in ReSig

Note: ffgw can only do Gamma point calculations
